# image-quantization-kmeans
A Python project that demonstrates three methods of image color quantization and compression: manual indexing, KMeans clustering in RGB space, and KMeans clustering in HSV space. The project reduces the number of colors in an image, reconstructs the compressed version, and compares file sizes to visualize the effectiveness of each technique.
